<h3>Notes about Group.characterstic.valueCodeableConcept</h3>
<p>
If a CodeableConcept with multiple Codings is used to represent the value of the characteristic, the Codings are to be interpreted as connected with an OR. <br/>
So, if the type is Medication and the CodeableConcept contains multiple Codings for different medications, any person that takes at least one of the medications has this characterstic. <br/>
This interpretation allows for characteristics to specify, that any participant should have one of a list of items if the study is more general. <br/>
For conditions this could be a list of different heart conditions, if the study is about heart conditions in general, or a list of medication if the study is about a group of drugs with a common active incredient.
