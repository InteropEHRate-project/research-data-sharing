<h3>Notes on the pseudonymization process</h3>
<p>
For the research scenario, random pseudonyms are used for privacy-preserving data sharing based on the signature scheme proposed in 'Jan Camenisch, Anna Lysyanskaya. "Signature Schemes and Anonymous Credentials from Bilinear Maps." CRYPTO 2004.'

This extension can be used in two different contexts with different meaning:
<ol>
<li>ResearchStudy: If the extension is part of a ResearchStudy it represents how the answers to the study SHOULD be anonymized before they are sent to the Researchcenter. </li>
<li>Other resources: If the extension is part of another resource it represents how the resource IS anonymized. Therefore a resource without this extension should be treated as not anomyized at all. </li>
</ol>
